            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" class="website">Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>Apple's website is known for its clean, minimalist design and focus on product showcasing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple uses strong contrast with white space and high-quality product images, making key elements stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, button styles, and layout patterns are repeated throughout the site, reinforcing branding.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are precisely aligned, creating a sense of order and professionalism.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is grouped logically, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/" target="_blank" class="website">Craigslist.org</a></h3>
            <p>Craigslist is a classic example of a utilitarian website that prioritizes functionality over aesthetics. Its design is often considered outdated and cluttered.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="Crap"><strong>Contrast:</strong> Craigslist uses minimal contrast, relying heavily on plain text and basic links, which can make it difficult to distinguish important elements.</li>
                <li class="Crap"><strong>Repetition:</strong> While Craigslist maintains a consistent layout across its various sections, the overall design lacks visual repetition that would enhance its aesthetic appeal.</li>
                <li class="Crap"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements on Craigslist are generally aligned, but the lack of visual hierarchy and consistent spacing contributes to a cluttered appearance.</li>
                <li class="Crap"><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is often grouped, but the sheer volume of text and links can overwhelm users and make it difficult to find specific items.</li>
